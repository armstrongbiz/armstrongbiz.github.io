          <p>I support individuals, small companies and NPOs in their English-language work. I am a native English-speaker, living in Munich, Germany.</p><p>
I have worked as a Market Researcher, Journalist, Academic and a Writer and Editor. I have also worked as a Lecturer (teaching Media Theory), and as an English Trainer. My skills and experience enable me to support German companies in their marketing and communications work. You may be interested in buying a particular service I offer (such as English Teaching or Writing and Editing [links]). Or, you may be interested in purchasing my time, having me in your offices for a set number of hours or days per week, to write, edit and support your English communication skills.

His love for and ability to connect deeply with people makes him a wonderful Thinking Partner. As a human being, Adam understands deeply the challenges we face in being authentic and vulnerable, and he brings his own ability to be deeply human and real to his work, which, I think, makes him a profoundly good coach and thinking partner.<class="quote-marks">"</span>
