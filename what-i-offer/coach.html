          <p>I offer a range of services, broadly I focus on supporting people. I do this in various ways; either as a a coach (with a focus on the emotional and the personal aspects to performance [link to coaching]), or as a trainer (with a focus on the cognitive, knowledge based aspects of learning and excelling [link to training]), or as a communications specialist (with a focus on writing, editing and presenting information, or empowering you to do those things [link to communications]). </p>
