          <p>Supporting others in their lives is one of my true passions. I work as a coach with people in various stages of their journeys. </p><p>
As a coach I offer a space, for thinking and for feeling. Using the Thinking Environment, I listen, deeply. In this space I enable clients to make empowered decisions, to reflect on what works, what they wish to keep and what they wish to discard. I aim to help people move away from acting by default and blindly repeating behaviours. I help them move towards understanding their own power; to choose and to act.</p><p>
My interest in coaching started while finishing my Masterâ€™s degree. I realised that the primary obstacle to my finishing was my own fear and self-doubt. I saw that was true for many of my colleagues; they struggled to believe they were capable of finishing their Masters or PhD theses and often that belief would stop them from finishing. 
I have completed the Time to Think Coaching training. I have been involved in my own personal development for 14 years, I have been exposed to various methodologies and approaches; Non-Violent Communication, the 12-steps, the Man Kind Project, the Landmark Forum and therapy (both group and individual).

His love for and ability to connect deeply with people makes him a wonderful Thinking Partner. As a human being, Adam understands deeply the challenges we face in being authentic and vulnerable, and he brings his own ability to be deeply human and real to his work, which, I think, makes him a profoundly good coach and thinking partner.<class="quote-marks">"</span>
