I have extensive experience as a writer and as an editor. I have written for a diverse range of audiences across multiple topics. I am able to write, edit and finalise documents. I have written and published in academic journals, as a news journalist, as a government researcher, for market research and for legal documents. I have worked as a ghost writer for various clients, editing business, legal and academic documents. </p><p>
I also offer a specialised course on ‘Writing Well in English’.
